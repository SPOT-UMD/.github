# DTC
If you are working on DTC you will likely need to build and install the cdcl_umd_msgs repository, instructions can be found in the [README for the repository](https://github.com/UMD-CDCL/cdcl_umd_msgs)

The file structure on most DTC base station devices is:
```
/home/<USER>/
 └── DTC/
     ├── cdcl_ws/
     │   └── src/
     │       └── cdcl_umd_msgs/
     └── inference_engine/
```
